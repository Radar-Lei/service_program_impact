Assessing the effectiveness of transit improvement programs is crucial to improving urban mobility, but traditional methods often lack timeliness and cannot capture passenger travel experiences. Although social media data can provide a wealth of real-time public opinions, there is a major research gap: Few studies have used these data to evaluate the impact of specific transit improvement projects by comparing passenger attitudes before and after implementation. To fill this gap, this paper proposes a new framework that combines advanced text mining with causal inference methods. Our approach uses semantic matching to associate unstructured social media posts with specific transit programs and uses interruption time series analysis (ITSA) to quantify changes in passenger sentiment while controlling for potential time-trend effects. We apply the framework to a case study from Shenzhen Metro and analyze 88253 Weibo posts to evaluate six different service improvement programs. The results showed that the framework is effective in measuring the impact of the improvement programs, showing that technology-oriented upgrades significantly improved public emotional attitudes over time, while other interventions had negligible effects. The study provides transit agencies with a reliable, data-based method to conduct evidence-based project assessments and better understand passenger travel experiences.
